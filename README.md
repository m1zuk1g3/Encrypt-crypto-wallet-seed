I an s.txt file we have sample 12 word crypto wallet seed

![seed1](https://github.com/m1zuk1g3/Encrypt-crypto-wallet-seed/assets/10275662/c4523cba-f46a-4992-a5e8-d96612d5a7b1)



Program ask you for birth date, for example we use 1997

In output we have 4 numbers in a row that represent first 4 letters from seed word

first row 1997-3994-1997-27958 this is how we store out seed on paper or metal sheet in home :)

then devine it by your date:

1997 / 1997 = 1 

3994 / 1997 = 2 

1997 / 1997 = 1

27958 / 1997 = 14


Out numbers are posiotion letter from alphabet 1 = a, 2 = b, 14 = n so we get fist 4 letters aban 

in BIP-39 we have 2048 words with first 4 letters we can find only one word so aban = abandon
